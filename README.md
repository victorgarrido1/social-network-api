## The Task For This Application
MongoDB is a popular choice for social network web applications. We are instructed to build API where users can share thoughts, create a thought and become friends on the platform.
We uses Express.js and Mongoose for the packages. In this application, we do have seed data to begin with. Please feel free to use it

## Goals
The goal of this application is intended for a API web application where users can share thoughts, react to friends thoughts and create a friends list. Using this application.

## What I've Learned 
This project consists of using JavaScript and Mongoose, Node,js and Express. Each all of these tools are used hand on hand. And with that, understanding "all gears of the clock" needs to be considered when you want to use Routes and being able to display information. As a new coming developer I very eagerly want to understand the breakdown of concepts and use them in their corresponding manner.
